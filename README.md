# Hyper-Fighters-Unity
A Unity version of hyper highters, moving over from unreal engine.

This is to take the idea of hyper fighters and add vissuals to it.
Since the mecanics and gameplay of hyper fighters already exits in it's own repository this is mostly focused on the visual asspects
of the game and won't have much gameplay until I feel the visuals are at the same level of development as the mechanics in hyper fighters.
